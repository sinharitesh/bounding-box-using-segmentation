# Bounding Box generation using Image Segmentation.

This repository provides training and inferencing modules for Pneumonia Detection. This aim of this project is to provide a cookie cutter approach to generate bounding box predictions for Chest X Rays.

There are many object detection techniques are available today for generation of bounding boxes like YoloV5, R-CNN, Faster R-CNN etc. Segmentation is primarily a technque which marks 
Here I am using segmentation to generate bounding boxes.
